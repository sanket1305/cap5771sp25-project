# 🎬 Movie Recommendation System

Welcome to the **Movie Recommendation System** project! This repository contains the code for a Data Science project focused on building a movie recommendation system using data analysis and visualization techniques.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

The system is built on three datasets (detailed in the _"Milestone 1.pdf"_ report). The code in this repository processes these datasets to perform data analysis, generate insightful visualizations, and build a recommendation model.

To run the project, please review the key files listed below.

## ▶️ Running the Project

> ⚠️ It is recommended to set up a Conda environment and install the required dependencies before starting.

Launch the Jupyter notebooks using Anaconda Navigator or the terminal.

### Execution Steps:

1. **Run `Milestone1.ipynb`**  
    Loads and preprocesses the data, saving it in normalized format in the `/Data/` directory.
    
2. **Run `Milestone2.ipynb`**  
    Trains four models: Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, and XGBoost. Saves models in the `models/` folder.
    
3. **Run `Milestone2_v2.ipynb`**  
    Trains three additional models: KMeans, KNN, and HDBScan. These models and their respective features/labels are stored in nested directories inside `models/`.
    
4. **Run `Milestone3.ipynb`**  
    Tests and evaluates performance of all six distinct models (Linear Regresion was discarded and not tested on test data due to it's high MSE score insights).
    
5. **Launch the Web UI**  
    Execute the following command in your terminal:
    
   ``` bash
    streamlit run dashboard.py
   ```
    
    This will open the dashboard in your default web browser.
