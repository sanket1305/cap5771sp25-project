# Movie Recommendation System

Welcome to the Movie Recommendation System project! This repository contains the code for a Data Science project focused on building a movie recommendation system using data analysis and visualization techniques.

## Project Overview

The system is built on three datasets (detailed in the "Milestone 1.pdf" report). The code in this repository processes these datasets to perform data analysis, create insightful visualizations, and build a recommendation model.

To run the project, please review the following key files in the repository:

### Files Overview

1. **analysis.py**: Contains functions for data analysis (e.g., preprocessing, exploration, and feature extraction).
2. **visualizations.py**: Contains functions for generating various data visualizations and graphs.
3. **main.py**: The main script that imports functions from `analysis.py` and `visualizations.py` and triggers the entire process.
4. **Images/**: Contains the graph images generated during the analysis. These images are saved for visual reference.
5. **Report/**: Includes milestone reports, including "Milestone 1.pdf," which provides an overview of the datasets and the project.
6. **Data/**: Includes the data files used for the project (Note: Large files are not included in this repository due to size constraints).

### Data Files

Some of the data files used in this project are too large to upload directly to GitHub due to file size limitations. However, you can download the full dataset (which contains the exact data files used in the project) from the following location:

### Running the Project

To generate all the images and analyze the data, simply run the `main.py` file. The following will happen:

- The terminal will display analysis results and debugging logs.
- Any generated visualizations (graphs) will be saved in the "Images" folder.

### Prerequisites

Make sure to have the following Python libraries installed:

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- sqlite
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

You can install them using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

### How to Run

- Download the dataset (instructions provided above).
- Place the dataset files in the Data/ folder.
- There are 2 .ipynb files
- Execute them in order of milestones

This will trigger the data analysis and generate plots, which will be saved in the Images/ folder.
